# Weather-App-for-Shipping
App that queries the weather for the next 5 days to determine the proper cold chain packaging to use for pharmaceutical shipping. The user inputs a U.S. city and the travel duration and the program produces a graph of the 5-day forecast at the destination city along with the required packaging for the shipment.

PLEASE obtain an API key from the weather api provider, they are free if you lightly use them. Pasting this program into Anaconda3>Lib>site-packages folder on your computer will have all of the required import packages for running the program.
